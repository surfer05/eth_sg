**Introduction**

**Encrypted_Compute** is an innovative platform designed to enable secure computations on private data using advanced computational models, such as machine learning models and large language models (LLMs), without exposing the data to model providers or any third parties. This solution is particularly crucial in fields where data privacy is paramount, such as healthcare, finance, and personal data analytics.

**Problem Statement**

Users often possess sensitive or private data that they cannot share publicly due to privacy concerns, legal restrictions, or personal preferences. Despite this, they may wish to leverage advanced computational models to gain insights, predictions, or analyses from their data. For instance, consider a patient suffering from a severe oral disease that results in distressing images. The patient wants to obtain a diagnosis or prognosis using AI models but is reluctant to share these images publicly or with model providers due to privacy concerns.

**Solution Overview**

Encrypted_Compute addresses this challenge by providing a secure platform where users can:

- **Encrypt their private data** using Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE).
- **Select and utilize computational models** from various model creators.
- **Specify initial layers of the model** to perform computations on encrypted data.
- **Ensure data remains confidential** throughout the computation process.
- **Receive results** without ever exposing their raw data.

**Detailed Explanation**

1. **Data Encryption with Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)**

   - **What is FHE?**
     - Fully Homomorphic Encryption is an advanced cryptographic technique that allows computations to be performed directly on encrypted data without needing to decrypt it first.
     - The result of these computations is also in encrypted form and, when decrypted, matches the outcome of operations performed on the plaintext data.

   - **User Data Encryption**
     - Users upload their sensitive data (e.g., medical images) to the Encrypted_Compute platform.
     - The platform encrypts the data using FHE algorithms, ensuring that the data remains secure and inaccessible to unauthorized parties, including the platform itself.

2. **Model Selection and Layer Specification**

   - **Model Repository**
     - The platform hosts a repository of computational models uploaded by various model creators.
     - These models can range from machine learning algorithms to complex neural networks and LLMs.

   - **User Choice and Customization**
     - Users browse and select a model that suits their needs.
     - Due to the computational intensity of performing operations on encrypted data, users can specify which initial layers of the model they want to run on their encrypted data.
     - This partitioning is essential because processing the entire model on encrypted data is currently impractical due to computational limitations.

3. **Secure Computation in a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE)**

   - **What is a TEE?**
     - A Trusted Execution Environment is a secure area within a processor that ensures code and data loaded inside are protected with respect to confidentiality and integrity.
     - TEEs prevent unauthorized access and tampering while code is executing within them.

   - **Utilizing Phala Network**
     - The Encrypted_Compute platform leverages the **Phala Network**, which provides decentralized TEE services.
     - Phala Network allows computations to be performed in a secure and private manner, ensuring that the encrypted data remains confidential.

   - **Computational Constraints**
     - Phala Network's TEE services have a time limit, typically around 1 minute.
     - This limitation necessitates efficient computation and is another reason for processing only the initial layers of the model within the TEE.

4. **Intermediate Output Decryption and Obfuscation**

   - **Decrypting the Output**
     - After the computation within the TEE, the resulting output (still encrypted) is decrypted by the platform.
     - This output is an intermediate representation of the data after being processed by the initial model layers.

   - **Obfuscated Data**
     - The decrypted output is obfuscated, meaning it is transformed in a way that retains essential features needed for further computation but does not reveal the original sensitive data.
     - Obfuscation ensures that even if the data is intercepted or accessed by unauthorized parties, the original information cannot be reconstructed.

5. **Final Computation by Model Creator**

   - **Transferring Obfuscated Data**
     - The obfuscated intermediate data is securely transferred to the model creator.
     - The model creator processes this data through the remaining layers of their model.

   - **Data Privacy Assurance**
     - The model creator does not have access to the user's raw data at any point.
     - The obfuscated data is designed to prevent reverse-engineering or reconstruction of the original data.

6. **Result Delivery to User**

   - **Receiving the Final Output**
     - The model creator sends the final computation results back to the Encrypted_Compute platform.
     - The platform then delivers these results to the user.

   - **Confidentiality Maintained**
     - Throughout the entire process, the user's data remains confidential.
     - The user obtains the desired output without compromising their privacy.

**Advantages of Encrypted_Compute**

- **Enhanced Data Privacy**
  - Users can utilize advanced computational models without exposing their sensitive data.
  - The combination of FHE and TEE technologies ensures end-to-end data confidentiality.

- **Flexibility and Control**
  - Users can choose which parts of the model to run on their data.
  - This allows for customization based on computational constraints and privacy preferences.

- **Secure Collaboration**
  - Model creators can offer their services without risking exposure to sensitive data.
  - Encourages more widespread adoption of AI and ML models in sensitive fields.

- **Scalability**
  - The platform can be expanded to include more models and support a larger user base.
  - Modular design allows for integration with various computational models and services.
