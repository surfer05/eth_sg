# Encrypted_Compute

## Introduction

**Encrypted_Compute** is a platform designed to enable secure computations on private data using machine learning models without exposing the data to the model owners or any third parties. It bridges the gap between data privacy and the utility of advanced computational models, making it particularly useful in sensitive fields like healthcare.

## Problem Statement

Users often possess sensitive data that they cannot share publicly due to privacy concerns but still wish to leverage advanced models to gain insights or predictions from their data. For example, a patient with a rare medical condition may want to get a diagnosis using AI models but is reluctant to share personal medical images due to privacy issues.

## Solution Overview

Encrypted_Compute addresses this challenge by:

- Allowing **data users** to securely run computations on their encrypted data.
- Enabling **model creators** to offer their models without accessing the users' raw data.
- Utilizing **Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)** and **Trusted Execution Environments (TEE)** to maintain data confidentiality throughout the computation process.

## Features

- **Data Privacy:** User data remains encrypted during computations.
- **Model Flexibility:** Users can select which initial layers of the model to compute.
- **Secure Computation:** Computations are performed in a TEE using Phala Network.
- **Time Efficiency:** Model partitioning optimizes computation within TEE time limits.
- **Obfuscated Intermediate Data:** Ensures that model creators cannot reverse-engineer user data.
- **Seamless Integration:** Model creators can easily deploy their models on the platform.

## How It Works

### For Data Users

1. **Data Upload and Encryption:**
   - Users upload their private data (e.g., medical images) to the platform.
   - The data is encrypted using Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE).

2. **Model Selection and Layer Specification:**
   - Users select a model from the platform's repository.
   - They specify the initial layers of the model to compute on their encrypted data.

3. **Secure Computation in TEE:**
   - The encrypted data is processed through the selected model layers within a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) provided by Phala Network.
   - The TEE ensures secure and private computations.

4. **Intermediate Output Decryption:**
   - The output from the TEE is decrypted.
   - This decrypted output is an obfuscated representation, maintaining data privacy.

5. **Final Computation by Model Creator:**
   - The obfuscated data is sent to the model creator.
   - The model creator processes it through the remaining layers of the model.

6. **Result Delivery:**
   - The final output is sent back to the user.
   - The user's data remains confidential throughout the process.

### For Model Creators

1. **Model Upload:**
   - Model creators upload their machine learning models to the platform.
   - They can partition their models into layers to facilitate efficient computation.

2. **Computation on Obfuscated Data:**
   - Receive obfuscated intermediate data from users.
   - Run the remaining model layers on this data.

3. **Result Submission:**
   - Send the final computation results back to the platform for delivery to the user.
   - At no point do they access the user's raw data.

### Components

- **Frontend Interface:**
  - User-friendly dashboards for data users and model creators.
  - Built with modern web technologies (e.g., React.js).

- **Backend Server:**
  - Handles authentication, data management, and communication.
  - Developed using Python frameworks like Django or Flask.

- **Encryption Module:**
  - Implements FHE for data encryption and decryption.
  - Ensures data remains secure during computations.

- **Trusted Execution Environment (TEE):**
  - Utilizes Phala Network's TEE for secure computations.
  - Enforces a computation time limit of 1 minute.

- **Model Repository:**
  - Stores models uploaded by creators.
  - Supports model partitioning for layer-specific computations.

- **Communication Layer:**
  - Manages secure data transfer between users, the platform, and model creators.
  - Uses encrypted channels to prevent data interception.
